An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a structured document to capture an important architectural decision and its rationale. Here's a step-by-step guide to create an ADR for your decision to use a NoSQL Document-based database for a product catalog service:

ADR: Use of NoSQL Document-Based Database for Product Catalog Service

1. Title

Unique identifier and meaningful title, e.g., "ADR-001: Use of NoSQL Document-Based Database for Product Catalog Service"


2. Context

Explain the situation, background, and forces at play.
Example:

The product catalog service is a core component that needs to manage a dynamic and hierarchical data structure with fields that vary across different product types.

The database should support fast, scalable, and flexible querying and updates, given the expected growth in product data and user base.

Traditional relational databases require predefined schemas and may not handle hierarchical data efficiently without complex joins.

Other NoSQL types, like key-value, wide-column, or graph databases, were considered but have their limitations for this use case.


3. Decision

State the decision clearly.
Example:

We have decided to use a NoSQL Document-Based Database (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase, or DynamoDB) for storing product catalog data.


4. Rationale

Provide reasons for the decision, including comparisons.
Example:

1. Flexibility in Schema: Products in the catalog can have vastly different attributes. A document-based model allows schema-less design, simplifying storage and updates.


2. Efficient Handling of Hierarchical Data: Document databases store data in formats like JSON or BSON, naturally aligning with hierarchical product data structures.


3. Scalability: Document databases offer horizontal scaling capabilities, which are crucial for handling high volumes of catalog data and user requests.


4. Performance: By embedding related data within a single document, queries are faster compared to relational databases that require multiple table joins.


5. Alternatives:

Relational Databases: Lack flexibility for schema changes and require joins for hierarchical data, which impact performance.

Key-Value Stores: Simplistic and lack querying capabilities for complex filtering.

Wide-Column Databases: Better for time-series data or sparse data but lack hierarchical data support.

Graph Databases: Suitable for relationship-heavy data but add unnecessary complexity for this use case.




5. Consequences

Describe the outcomes, trade-offs, and implications.
Example:

Positive Impacts:

Simplifies data modeling and updates.

Enhances query performance for catalog data.

Provides scalability for future growth.


Negative Impacts:

Requires team training to manage and optimize a NoSQL database.

Potential challenges in maintaining consistency for complex transactions.



6. Status

Indicate the current status of the decision.
Example:

Accepted (if finalized)

Proposed (if still under review)


7. Implementation Plan

Outline the steps to adopt the decision.
Example:

Evaluate and finalize the specific NoSQL document database provider (e.g., MongoDB or DynamoDB).

Train the development team on the chosen database.

Design and implement a database schema for the product catalog.

Develop and test APIs for data ingestion and retrieval.


8. Related Decisions

Link to other relevant ADRs, if any.

9. References

List any supporting documentation or sources that informed the decision.
Example:

"Comparison of NoSQL Databases for Hierarchical Data"

Documentation for MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Couchbase

Tips

Use simple language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon.

Keep the document concise and to the point.

Regularly review and update the ADR as the project evolves.
