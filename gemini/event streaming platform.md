Can you provide a comparison between event streaming platforms to decide which could be used along with mongodb as an event sourcing datastore  in azure when Implementing CQRS.


When implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with event sourcing, choosing the right event streaming platform alongside MongoDB as the event sourcing datastore in Azure is critical. Hereâ€™s a comparison of key event streaming platforms to help make an informed decision:

Comparison of Event Streaming Platforms

Analysis

1. Apache Kafka:

Strengths:

Ideal for event sourcing with Kafka Connect for MongoDB (sink/source connectors).

Supports replayability of events and log compaction for retention.

Mature ecosystem and broad adoption.


Considerations:

Requires setup and management unless using a managed service like Confluent Kafka.


Use Case: If scalability, event retention, and ecosystem are top priorities.



2. Azure Event Hubs:

Strengths:

Native integration with Azure services.

Fully managed service with minimal maintenance.

Scales well for streaming events.


Considerations:

Requires custom connectors for MongoDB.


Use Case: If the architecture is primarily Azure-based and tight integration with Azure services is required.



3. RabbitMQ:

Strengths:

Simple setup and widely adopted message broker.

Supports message ordering.


Considerations:

Limited support for replay and persistence compared to Kafka or Pulsar.


Use Case: If the focus is on messaging rather than full-fledged event streaming.



4. Apache Pulsar:

Strengths:

Log-based storage similar to Kafka but with multi-tenancy and native geo-replication.

Native MongoDB connectors.


Considerations:

Growing ecosystem (less mature than Kafka).


Use Case: If multi-tenancy or geo-replication is required alongside MongoDB.



5. AWS Kinesis:

Strengths:

Scalable and reliable event streaming service.


Considerations:

Integration with Azure services requires additional layers, increasing complexity.


Use Case: If the architecture already involves AWS services and cross-cloud integration is acceptable.

Recommendation

For a CQRS implementation with MongoDB as the event sourcing datastore in Azure:

1. Apache Kafka (Managed or Open Source): Best for robust event sourcing with out-of-the-box connectors for MongoDB.


2. Azure Event Hubs: Ideal if the architecture leverages Azure services heavily and MongoDB connectors can be implemented or are not a limitation.


3. Apache Pulsar: Suitable if the system requires advanced multi-tenancy or geo-replication.



Let me know if you need help setting up any of these platforms or integrating them with MongoDB.
