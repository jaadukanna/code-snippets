Designing and Implementing Event Sourcing for an Insurance Quoting Service
Understanding the Problem
In the insurance domain, a quoting service is a critical component that provides potential customers with an estimated cost for insurance coverage. This involves complex calculations based on various factors like age, location, vehicle type, driving history, and more. Traditional approaches often rely on complex SQL queries or in-memory calculations, which can become cumbersome to maintain and scale as the business grows.
Event Sourcing Solution
Event Sourcing is a pattern where all changes to an application state are captured as a sequence of events. These events are stored in an append-only store, providing an immutable and auditable history of the system. In the context of an insurance quoting service, this means capturing every change made to a quote as an event.
Design Considerations
 * Event Types: Define a comprehensive set of event types to capture all relevant changes to a quote, such as:
   * QuoteCreated: Triggered when a new quote is initiated.
   * CustomerInformationUpdated: Triggered when customer details are modified.
   * VehicleInformationUpdated: Triggered when vehicle information is changed.
   * RiskAssessmentCompleted: Triggered when the risk assessment is finished.
   * QuoteApproved: Triggered when the quote is approved.
   * QuoteDeclined: Triggered when the quote is declined.
 * Event Store: Choose a suitable event store, such as:
   * Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform that can handle high throughput and low latency.
   * Amazon Kinesis: A scalable and durable stream processing service.
   * EventStoreDB: A dedicated event store database.
 * Event Handling: Implement event handlers to process incoming events and update the quote state accordingly. These handlers can be implemented as microservices or within the quoting service itself.
 * Read Model: Create a read model to provide a more efficient way to query and present quote data. This can be a materialized view, a separate database, or a combination of both.
Implementation Approach
 * Event Generation: When a user interacts with the quoting service, generate corresponding events and publish them to the event store.
 * Event Handling: Subscribe to the event stream and process incoming events. Update the quote state based on the event type and data.
 * Read Model Updates: Keep the read model synchronized with the event store. This can be done using a change data capture mechanism or by periodically replaying events.
 * Quote Calculation: Use the updated quote state from the read model to perform the final quote calculation.
Benefits of Event Sourcing
 * Immutability: Events are immutable, providing a reliable and auditable history of the system.
 * Flexibility: New features and functionalities can be added by creating new event handlers without affecting existing code.
 * Scalability: Event stores can be scaled horizontally to handle increasing data volumes.
 * Debugging: The event log can be used to replay events and debug issues.
Additional Considerations
 * Event Serialization: Choose a suitable serialization format for events, such as JSON or Protobuf.
 * Event Versioning: Implement a versioning mechanism to handle changes to event schemas.
 * Security: Ensure that events are securely stored and accessed.
 * Performance: Optimize event handling and read model updates for performance.
By adopting Event Sourcing, insurance companies can build more flexible, scalable, and maintainable quoting services that can adapt to changing business requirements and provide a better customer experience.

Can you provide more detailed  examples to illustrate the steps involved from the moment a quote is created (QuoteCreated) by a broker user while submitting a form on web/mobile app till it is stored in datastore. Also, provide details on how READ model is created and synced whenever WRITE model changes.



Certainly, let's break down the steps involved in detail, starting from quote creation to event storage and read model synchronization.
1. Quote Creation
 * User Interaction: A broker user fills out a quote request form on the web/mobile app. This form includes details like:
   * Customer Information (Name, Age, Contact)
   * Vehicle Information (Type, Make, Model, Year)
   * Coverage Options (Liability, Collision, Comprehensive)
 * Application Logic:
   * The application validates the input data.
   * A unique identifier (e.g., UUID) is generated for the quote.
   * A QuoteCreated event is created with the following data:
     * quoteId: Unique identifier of the quote.
     * brokerId: Identifier of the broker who created the quote.
     * customerInformation: Customer details.
     * vehicleInformation: Vehicle details.
     * coverageOptions: Selected coverage options.
     * timestamp: Timestamp of the event creation.
2. Event Publishing
 * The QuoteCreated event is published to the event store (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis). This can be done asynchronously using a message queue or synchronously by directly writing to the event store.
3. Event Handling
 * Write Model:
   * An event handler subscribes to the event stream.
   * Upon receiving a QuoteCreated event, the handler creates a new entry in the write model (e.g., a document in MongoDB) with the following:
     * quoteId: Unique identifier of the quote.
     * status: "CREATED"
     * createdAt: Timestamp of quote creation.
     * brokerId: Identifier of the broker.
     * customerInformation: Customer details.
     * vehicleInformation: Vehicle details.
     * coverageOptions: Selected coverage options.
     * eventHistory: An array to store all events related to this quote. Initially, it contains the QuoteCreated event.
 * Read Model:
   * Materialized View: The read model can be a materialized view of the write model. This can be achieved using:
     * Change Data Capture (CDC): The database (e.g., MongoDB) can be configured to capture changes to the write model and trigger updates to the read model.
     * Event Replay: The read model can be periodically rebuilt by replaying all events from the event store. This approach is more suitable for complex read models or when CDC is not feasible.
   * Structure: The read model can be optimized for specific queries, such as:
     * Summary View: A simplified view with key attributes for quick retrieval and display.
     * Search Index: Indexes for efficient searching and filtering.
4. Subsequent Events
 * As the quote progresses (e.g., risk assessment, approval/decline), new events are generated and published:
   * RiskAssessmentStarted
   * RiskAssessmentCompleted
   * QuoteApproved
   * QuoteDeclined
 * Event Handling:
   * Each event handler updates the write model and triggers updates to the read model.
   * The eventHistory array in the write model is updated with each new event.
Example: Handling a RiskAssessmentCompleted Event
 * Write Model:
   * The event handler updates the status field to "RISK_ASSESSED".
   * It adds the RiskAssessmentCompleted event to the eventHistory array.
 * Read Model:
   * The materialized view is updated to reflect the new status.
   * If the read model has a summary view, it updates the relevant fields (e.g., risk assessment status).
Key Considerations
 * Event Store Choice: The choice of event store (Kafka, Kinesis, EventStoreDB) depends on factors like throughput, latency, scalability, and integration with existing infrastructure.
 * Read Model Optimization: The design of the read model is crucial for performance. Consider using caching, indexes, and appropriate data partitioning strategies.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that events are processed correctly and that the read model remains consistent with the write model.
 * Testing: Thoroughly test the event handling logic and read model synchronization to ensure data integrity and system stability.
This detailed example illustrates the core concepts of Event Sourcing in the context of an insurance quoting service. By implementing this approach, you can build a system that is more flexible, scalable, and maintainable, while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations.

===////=


With this approach I see that there would be multiple records for a  specific quote , each one having the changes related to that change along with other fields which remain the same.Also,  I see the array field in that record having list of one or more events each with a change  related to this quote . How is the READ model updated with each such change.



You're absolutely right. In an Event Sourcing system, the write model would indeed contain a record for each quote, and this record would include an array of events capturing its entire history.
Here's how the read model is typically updated in such a scenario:
1. Event Handlers and Projections:
 * Event Handlers: When an event (e.g., RiskAssessmentCompleted) is published, the corresponding event handler is triggered. This handler is responsible for updating the write model and initiating the read model update.
 * Projections: Projections are the mechanisms that transform events into the read model. They can be:
   * In-memory: Simple projections can be handled within the event handler itself.
   * External: More complex projections might involve separate services or processes that subscribe to the event stream and update the read model asynchronously.
2. Read Model Update Strategies:
 * Incremental Updates:
   * Change Data Capture (CDC): If the write model is in a database, CDC tools can capture changes (e.g., new events added to the eventHistory array). The projection then reacts to these changes and updates the read model accordingly.
   * Event Stream Subscription: Projections can directly subscribe to the event stream. When a new event arrives, the projection updates the read model based on the event data.
 * Periodic Updates:
   * Event Replay: The projection can periodically replay all events from the beginning for a given quote. This is useful for:
     * Initializing the read model.
     * Recalculating the read model after significant changes or errors.
     * Handling complex projections that require processing the entire event history.
3. Example: RiskAssessmentCompleted Event
Let's assume the read model has a field currentStatus.
 * Event Handler:
   * Updates the status field in the write model to "RISK_ASSESSED".
   * Adds the RiskAssessmentCompleted event to the eventHistory array.
   * Triggers the read model projection.
 * Projection:
   * Receives the RiskAssessmentCompleted event.
   * Updates the currentStatus field in the read model to "RISK_ASSESSED".
Key Considerations:
 * Projection Complexity: The complexity of the projection will depend on the specific requirements of the read model.
 * Performance: For high-throughput systems, efficient projections are crucial. Consider techniques like batching, caching, and indexing.
 * Consistency: Ensure that the read model remains consistent with the write model, especially during updates.
By carefully designing and implementing these mechanisms, you can effectively synchronize the read model with the ever-evolving state of the quote, as captured by the event stream.
I hope this more detailed explanation clarifies how read models are updated in an Event Sourcing system with multiple events per quote!


=======


Can you provide more details on Projections and how to implement them.


Certainly, let's delve deeper into Projections in Event Sourcing.
Projections: Transforming Events into Read Models
Projections are the core mechanism for transforming the stream of events into the desired read models. They essentially "project" the event history into a specific view of the data.
Types of Projections
 * In-Memory Projections:
   * Simple and Fast: Often implemented within the event handler itself.
   * Suitable for: Simple read models, small-scale applications.
   * Example:
     * Updating a counter in memory when an "ItemAddedToCart" event is received.
     * Calculating a simple sum or average based on a series of events.
 * External Projections:
   * More Complex: Implemented as separate services or processes.
   * Suitable for: Complex read models, high-throughput systems, distributed architectures.
   * Technologies:
     * Libraries: Libraries like Akka Streams (Scala), RxJava (Java), or Kafka Streams can be used to build reactive projections.
     * Frameworks: Frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark provide powerful tools for stream processing and building complex projections.
     * Databases: Some databases (e.g., PostgreSQL with materialized views) can be used to create projections.
Implementation Approaches
 * Event Stream Subscription:
   * The projection subscribes to the event stream (e.g., Kafka topic, Kinesis stream).
   * For each incoming event, the projection logic is executed to update the read model.
   * Example:
     * A projection subscribes to "OrderPlaced" events.
     * It updates a "customerOrders" table in a database with the order details.
 * Change Data Capture (CDC):
   * If the write model is in a database, CDC tools can capture changes to the write model (e.g., new events added to the eventHistory array).
   * The projection reacts to these changes and updates the read model accordingly.
   * Suitable for: Databases that support CDC features.
 * Event Replay:
   * The projection replays all events from the beginning (or from a specific point in time).
   * This is useful for:
     * Initializing the read model.
     * Recalculating the read model after significant changes or errors.
     * Handling complex projections that require processing the entire event history.
Example: Building a Customer Order Summary Projection
Events:
 * OrderPlaced
 * OrderShipped
 * OrderCancelled
Read Model:
 * customerOrders table with columns:
   * customerId
   * totalOrders
   * totalShippedOrders
   * totalCancelledOrders
Projection Logic:
 * Subscribe to the event stream.
 * Handle OrderPlaced:
   * Increment totalOrders for the corresponding customerId.
 * Handle OrderShipped:
   * Increment totalShippedOrders for the corresponding customerId.
 * Handle OrderCancelled:
   * Increment totalCancelledOrders for the corresponding customerId.
Implementation (Conceptual):
// Pseudocode using a hypothetical event stream library
eventStream.subscribe(event -> {
    if (event instanceof OrderPlaced) {
        updateCustomerOrders(event.customerId, "totalOrders", 1); 
    } else if (event instanceof OrderShipped) {
        updateCustomerOrders(event.customerId, "totalShippedOrders", 1);
    } else if (event instanceof OrderCancelled) {
        updateCustomerOrders(event.customerId, "totalCancelledOrders", 1); 
    }
});

private void updateCustomerOrders(String customerId, String field, int increment) {
    // Logic to update the customerOrders table in the database
}

Key Considerations:
 * Projection Performance: Optimize projections for performance by using efficient data structures, caching, and batching techniques.
 * Idempotency: Ensure projections are idempotent, meaning they can be safely replayed multiple times without producing unintended side effects.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent data inconsistencies and ensure data integrity.
I hope this provides a more comprehensive understanding of Projections in Event Sourcing. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

Taking mongodb as an event Source datastore, how would we use the projections to update the READ model. Also, where would the handlers be running


Using MongoDB as an Event Store and Implementing Projections
1. Event Storage in MongoDB
 * Collection: Create a dedicated MongoDB collection to store all events.
 * Document Structure: Each document in this collection represents an event.
   * eventType: The type of the event (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "OrderShipped").
   * aggregateId: Unique identifier of the entity (e.g., order ID, customer ID).
   * eventId: Unique identifier of the event.
   * data: The event data (e.g., order details, customer information).
   * timestamp: Timestamp of the event occurrence.
2. Projection Implementation
 * Change Streams: MongoDB provides Change Streams, which allow you to efficiently observe changes to data in a collection.
 * Projection Logic:
   * Subscribe to Change Stream: Create a Change Stream on the events collection.
   * Handle Events: For each change in the stream:
     * Extract the eventType and data from the event document.
     * Apply the appropriate logic to update the read model based on the event type.
       * Example:
         * If eventType is "OrderPlaced":
           * Create a new document in the "orders" collection with order details.
         * If eventType is "OrderShipped":
           * Update the "status" field in the "orders" collection to "Shipped".
3. Read Model
 * Separate Collection: Create a separate collection in MongoDB to store the read model data.
 * Structure: Design the read model collection to optimize for specific queries and reporting needs.
4. Projection Execution
 * Dedicated Service: Run a separate service or process to handle the Change Stream and execute the projection logic. This allows for better isolation and scalability.
 * Example:
   * A Node.js or Python application can subscribe to the Change Stream using the MongoDB driver.
   * The application can then perform the necessary updates to the read model based on the received events.
Example Code Snippet (Conceptual - Node.js)
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function run() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://<your_connection_string>');
  await client.connect();
  const eventsCollection = client.db('your_database').collection('events');
  const ordersCollection = client.db('your_database').collection('orders');

  const changeStream = eventsCollection.watch();

  changeStream.on('change', (change) => {
    if (change.operationType === 'insert') {
      const event = change.fullDocument;
      if (event.eventType === 'OrderPlaced') {
        ordersCollection.insertOne({
          orderId: event.aggregateId,
          // ... other order details
        });
      }
      // Handle other event types similarly
    }
  });

  await client.close();
}

run().catch(console.error);

Key Considerations:
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to ensure that projections are processed correctly and that the read model remains consistent with the event stream.
 * Idempotency: Ensure that projections are idempotent, meaning they can be safely replayed multiple times without producing unintended side effects.
 * Performance: Optimize projections for performance by using appropriate indexes, batching updates, and efficient query patterns.
 * Scalability: Consider scaling the projection service horizontally to handle increasing event throughput.
By using this approach, you can effectively leverage MongoDB's Change Streams to implement efficient and scalable projections for your Event Sourcing architecture.

Wouldn't the data volume in the mongo collection increase thereby increasing storage costs



You're absolutely right. Using MongoDB as an event store will inevitably lead to an increase in data volume over time. Here's a breakdown of the factors and potential mitigation strategies:
Factors Contributing to Data Growth:
 * Every Change is an Event: In Event Sourcing, every modification to an entity results in a new event being stored. This creates a comprehensive history but also increases the volume of data.
 * Eventual Consistency: While projections aim to keep the read model up-to-date, there might be a slight delay. This means the event store always holds the complete and authoritative source of truth, leading to more data.
 * Long-Term Storage: If you need to retain a long history of events (e.g., for auditing, compliance, or historical analysis), the data volume will grow significantly over time.
Mitigating Data Volume Growth:
 * Data Retention Policies:
   * Time-based Retention: Define a retention period for events. After a certain time (e.g., 1 year), older events can be archived or deleted.
   * Event Pruning: Implement logic to selectively delete or archive less critical events. For example, you might only keep major state changes and discard minor updates.
 * Data Compression:
   * Efficient Serialization: Choose a compact serialization format for events (e.g., Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) to reduce storage space.
   * Compression Algorithms: Utilize compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, snappy) to further reduce the size of stored events.
 * Data Partitioning:
   * Sharding: If your event volume is very high, consider sharding your MongoDB collection to distribute data across multiple servers.
 * Cold Storage:
   * Archive Older Data: Archive older, less frequently accessed events to cheaper storage options (e.g., cloud storage like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
 * Event Sourcing vs. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
   * CQRS: In some cases, a CQRS architecture can help reduce the reliance on the event store for read operations. By separating read and write models, you can optimize the read model for performance and reduce the load on the event store.
Important Considerations:
 * Business Requirements: Carefully assess your business requirements for data retention and historical analysis.
 * Cost-Benefit Analysis: Evaluate the trade-offs between data volume, storage costs, and the value derived from having a complete event history.
By carefully considering these factors and implementing appropriate strategies, you can manage data volume growth in your MongoDB-based Event Sourcing system while ensuring you have the necessary data for auditing, analysis, and other critical needs.


========4


What is CQRS and how is it different from Event Sourcing.


CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
 * Core Principle: Separates the logic for handling commands (write operations) from the logic for handling queries (read operations).
 * Benefits:
   * Improved Performance: Optimized read models can be designed for specific queries, leading to faster response times.
   * Scalability: Read and write operations can be scaled independently based on their respective demands.
   * Flexibility: Allows for different data models and technologies to be used for reads and writes.
Event Sourcing
 * Core Principle: Stores all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
 * Benefits:
   * Immutability: Events are immutable, providing a reliable and auditable history of the system.
   * Flexibility: New features and functionalities can be added by creating new event handlers without affecting existing code.
   * Scalability: Event stores can be scaled horizontally to handle increasing data volumes.
   * Debugging: The event log can be used to replay events and debug issues.
Relationship Between CQRS and Event Sourcing
 * Complementary: CQRS and Event Sourcing are often used together, but they are not mutually dependent.
 * Event Sourcing Enables CQRS: Event Sourcing provides a natural foundation for CQRS. The events generated by the write side can be used to populate and maintain the read models.
 * CQRS Can Be Used Without Event Sourcing: CQRS can be implemented without using Event Sourcing. In such cases, the write model and read model can be separate databases or views, but they are still designed and optimized for different purposes.
Key Differences
| Feature | CQRS | Event Sourcing |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Separating read and write logic | Storing all changes as events |
| Primary Goal | Improved performance and scalability | Immutability, auditability, and flexibility |
| Data Storage | Can use various storage mechanisms | Requires an event store |
| Read Model | Can be optimized for specific queries | Often derived from the event stream |
In Summary
 * CQRS is an architectural pattern that focuses on separating read and write operations for better performance and scalability.
 * Event Sourcing is a persistence mechanism that stores all changes as a sequence of events.
 * While they can be used independently, CQRS and Event Sourcing are often used together to create highly scalable, flexible, and auditable systems.
I hope this clarifies the distinction between CQRS and Event Sourcing!


======


For the same scenario I mentioned,  if I go with CQRS approach would that be better.


In the context of your insurance quoting service, adopting a CQRS approach alongside Event Sourcing can offer several significant advantages:
1. Enhanced Performance and Scalability:
 * Optimized Read Paths: You can design highly optimized read models specifically tailored for common queries, such as:
   * Quick quote previews: A simplified read model with key attributes for rapid display.
   * Broker dashboards: Aggregated data on quotes, conversions, and other relevant metrics.
   * Underwriting analysis: Read models designed for risk assessment and underwriting decisions.
 * Independent Scaling: Read and write operations can be scaled independently based on their respective demands. For example, if read traffic surges during peak hours, you can scale the read model servers horizontally without impacting the write operations.
2. Improved Readability and Maintainability:
 * Separation of Concerns: By separating read and write models, you reduce the complexity of each component. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
 * Flexibility in Data Modeling: You can use different data structures and technologies for read and write models. For example, the write model might use a document database like MongoDB, while the read model could leverage a relational database like PostgreSQL for optimized queries.
3. Enhanced Data Availability:
 * Read Model Caching: You can implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed read models, further improving read performance and reducing latency.
 * Eventual Consistency: While the read model might not always reflect the absolute latest state due to eventual consistency, it can still provide accurate and up-to-date information for most use cases.
Example in the Insurance Quoting Context:
 * Write Model:
   * Uses Event Sourcing to capture all changes to a quote as a sequence of events (e.g., QuoteCreated, CustomerInformationUpdated, RiskAssessmentCompleted).
   * Stores the complete event history for each quote.
 * Read Models:
   * Quote Summary Model: A simplified view with key attributes for quick display on the broker portal.
   * Underwriting Analysis Model: A more detailed model with risk factors and scores for underwriters.
   * Broker Dashboard Model: Aggregated data on quote volumes, conversion rates, and other key performance indicators.
Implementing CQRS with Event Sourcing in MongoDB:
 * Write Model:
   * Use MongoDB to store events as described earlier.
   * Utilize a framework or library for event handling and state management.
 * Read Models:
   * Create separate MongoDB collections for each read model.
   * Use Change Streams to efficiently capture changes to the event stream and update the read models accordingly.
In Summary:
By adopting CQRS alongside Event Sourcing, you can significantly enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of your insurance quoting service. The ability to optimize read models for specific use cases and scale them independently will prove invaluable as your business grows and your application evolves.
Note: While CQRS offers numerous benefits, it also introduces additional complexity. Carefully evaluate the trade-offs between the benefits and the increased architectural complexity before implementing CQRS in your specific context.

If instead of using mongodb as  event source datastore, can we consider azure event Hubs and if yes,  how would it work



Yes, absolutely! Azure Event Hubs is an excellent choice for an event source datastore in your insurance quoting service. Here's how it would work:
1. Event Publishing:
 * Application to Event Hubs: Your application (e.g., web/mobile app, backend service) would publish events to the Event Hubs instance.
 * Event Format: Serialize events into a suitable format (e.g., JSON, Avro) for efficient transmission.
2. Event Handling and Projections:
 * Event Hubs Consumers: Create consumer groups within the Event Hubs instance. Each consumer group represents a separate stream of events.
 * Projection Logic:
   * Each consumer group would be associated with a specific projection.
   * The projection logic would consume events from the corresponding consumer group.
   * Based on the event type, the projection would update the appropriate read model (e.g., update the "orders" collection in MongoDB).
3. Read Model Updates:
 * Consumer Groups and Projections: Each consumer group would be responsible for updating a specific part of the read model.
 * Example:
   * One consumer group might handle "OrderPlaced" events and update the "orderDetails" collection.
   * Another consumer group might handle "OrderShipped" events and update the "shipmentStatus" in the "orderDetails" collection.
4. Advantages of Using Azure Event Hubs:
 * High Throughput: Event Hubs is designed to handle massive volumes of events per second, making it suitable for high-traffic applications.
 * Scalability: Event Hubs can scale automatically to accommodate fluctuating event volumes.
 * Low Latency: Events are delivered to consumers with low latency, enabling real-time or near real-time processing.
 * Integration: Event Hubs integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, such as Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Databricks.
5. Implementation Considerations:
 * Consumer Group Management: Carefully manage consumer groups to ensure efficient event distribution and prevent data duplication.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that events are processed correctly and that the read model remains consistent.
 * Security: Securely authenticate and authorize access to the Event Hubs instance.
Example (Conceptual - Python with Azure Event Hubs SDK):
from azure.eventhub import EventHubConsumerClient

def on_event(partition_context, event):
    # Extract event data
    event_data = event.body_as_json() 
    event_type = event_data['eventType']

    # Process event based on type
    if event_type == 'OrderPlaced':
        # Update 'orders' collection in MongoDB 
    elif event_type == 'OrderShipped':
        # Update 'shipmentStatus' in MongoDB

consumer_client = EventHubConsumerClient.from_connection_string(
    conn_str="<your_connection_string>", 
    consumer_group="<your_consumer_group_name>" 
)

with consumer_client:
    receiver = consumer_client.receive()
    for event in receiver:
        on_event(event.partition_context, event)

By utilizing Azure Event Hubs as your event source datastore, you can leverage its scalability and performance to build a highly efficient and responsive event-driven architecture for your insurance quoting service.



=====/=/


Do you mean we have both READ and WRITE models in same collection when using Azure Event Hubs.


No, when using Azure Event Hubs with CQRS, you would typically have separate collections (or tables) for your write model and read models in your chosen database (like MongoDB).
 * Write Model:
   * Event Store: You would use the Event Hubs to store the stream of events.
   * State Store: You might use a separate collection in MongoDB to store the current state of each aggregate (e.g., a "quotes" collection). This state can be updated by event handlers that process events from the Event Hubs.
 * Read Models:
   * Separate Collections: You would create separate collections in MongoDB for each read model (e.g., "quoteSummaries", "underwritingAnalyses", "brokerDashboards").
   * Projections: Projections would consume events from Event Hubs and update the corresponding read model collections.
Here's a simplified illustration:
 * Event Publishing: Your application publishes events (e.g., "QuoteCreated", "RiskAssessmentCompleted") to the Event Hubs.
 * Event Handling:
   * Event handlers subscribe to the Event Hubs and process incoming events.
   * They update the "quotes" collection (write model) with the latest state.
 * Read Model Updates:
   * Projections subscribe to the Event Hubs.
   * Based on the event type, they update the corresponding read model collections (e.g., "quoteSummaries", "underwritingAnalyses").
Key Points:
 * Event Hubs is for events: It primarily serves as a high-throughput, low-latency event streaming platform.
 * Database for models: You would typically use a database like MongoDB to store the write model state and the various read models.
 * Projections: Projections act as the bridge between the event stream (Event Hubs) and the read models.
I hope this clarifies the separation of concerns between the event store (Event Hubs), the write model, and the read models when using Azure Event Hubs in a CQRS architecture.


==========


Do you mean we would not be having multiple records , for eaxh such change to the quote for a specific quote as in WRITE model


You're absolutely correct!
In the context of Event Sourcing, the write model would still maintain a record of all events related to a specific quote.
 * Event History: Each quote record in the write model would typically include an array or list to store all events that have occurred for that quote.
Here's why:
 * Complete History: The write model needs to retain the complete event history for:
   * Auditing and Compliance: To track all changes made to a quote for regulatory or legal purposes.
   * Debugging and Troubleshooting: To replay events and diagnose issues if necessary.
   * Potential Future Needs: The complete history might be valuable for future features or analysis that were not initially anticipated.
Example:
 * Quote Created:
   * quoteId: 123
   * customerInformation: ...
   * vehicleInformation: ...
   * coverageOptions: ...
   * eventHistory:
     * [ { "eventType": "QuoteCreated", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T10:30:00Z", "data": { ... } },  { "eventType": "RiskAssessmentCompleted", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T10:45:00Z", "data": { ... } },  { "eventType": "QuoteApproved", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T11:00:00Z", "data": { ... } }  ]
Key Points:
 * Event Hubs for Streaming: Azure Event Hubs is primarily for streaming events to consumers (projections).
 * Write Model for State: The write model (potentially in MongoDB) maintains the current state and the complete event history for each quote.
 * Read Models for Queries: Read models are optimized for specific queries and are updated by projections that consume events from Event Hubs.
I apologize for any previous confusion. I hope this clarification is helpful!
