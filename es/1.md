Using an Event Sourcing data store with a quoting service in the insurance domain offers numerous benefits, such as auditability, flexibility in processing, and scalability. Here's a detailed solution design and implementation approach:


---

Solution Design

Overview

An Event Sourcing pattern stores all changes to an application's state as a series of immutable events. In the quoting service, every operation, such as creating a quote, updating, or finalizing it, is captured as an event. The service can then rebuild the current state of a quote by replaying the events.


---

Key Components

1. Event Store:

A database optimized for storing and retrieving events (e.g., Kafka, DynamoDB, EventStoreDB).

Stores events such as QuoteCreated, QuoteUpdated, and QuoteFinalized.



2. Command and Event Handlers:

Command Handler: Processes commands like "create quote" or "update quote" and validates business rules.

Event Handler: Listens to events and triggers actions like updating projections or notifying systems.



3. Read Models (Projections):

Materialized views built from the event stream for fast querying.

Read models for quoting may include:

Active Quotes by Customer

Premium Breakdown by Product




4. Domain Model:

Represents core entities like Quote, Coverage, and Customer.

Handles business logic and ensures consistency during event creation.



5. Integration Layer:

APIs to interact with other systems (e.g., policy management, customer CRM).



6. Message Broker (Optional):

Kafka or RabbitMQ to distribute events to downstream consumers.





---

Event Flow

1. Command: A user or external system sends a command (e.g., "Create Quote").


2. Event: The system validates the command and generates an event (e.g., QuoteCreated).


3. Event Store: The event is persisted in the event store.


4. Projections: Events are processed to update read models.


5. API Response: The quoting service responds with the quote's ID or status.


6. Notification: Events can notify downstream systems, such as underwriting.

Event Types for a Quoting Service

QuoteCreated

QuoteUpdated

CoverageAdded

CoverageRemoved

QuoteFinalized

QuoteExpired

QuoteRejected



---

Key Design Considerations

1. Consistency:

Use eventual consistency for read models to ensure scalability.

Use ACID transactions within the event store.



2. Scalability:

Partition events by QuoteID for distributed systems.

Use sharding if the event store supports it.



3. Auditability:

Every change is logged as an event, providing a full audit trail.



4. Event Versioning:

Design for backward compatibility in event schemas.



5. Replayability:

Ensure the event store supports replaying events to rebuild state.

Implementation Approach

Step 1: Choose Technology Stack

Event Store:

Use specialized databases like EventStoreDB or a combination of Kafka/DynamoDB.


Language: Use a domain-relevant language like Java (with Spring Boot) or Python.

Frameworks:

Axon Framework for Java.

Akka for Scala/Java.

Custom implementations in other languages.


Cloud Services:

AWS Kinesis or DynamoDB Streams for event storage and processing.

Azure Event Hub for event streaming.




---

Step 2: Define Event Schema

Create a schema for each event type using JSON or Avro.

Include metadata such as:

Event ID

Timestamp

Correlation ID (for tracking across systems)




---

Step 3: Develop the Command and Event Handlers

Implement business logic in command handlers.

Generate events upon successful validation.

Persist events in the event store.



---

Step 4: Build Read Models

Use stream processors like Kafka Streams, AWS Lambda, or Akka Streams to generate read models.

Create denormalized views in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) or relational database.



---

Step 5: Implement APIs

Create Quote API: Accepts input and triggers QuoteCreated event.

Update Quote API: Triggers events for updates.

Get Quote API: Queries the read model for the latest quote state.



---

Step 6: Ensure Fault Tolerance

Enable retries and idempotency in event processing.

Use a distributed event store for durability.



---

Step 7: Monitor and Observe

Implement logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana).

Track key metrics such as event processing latency and storage usage.



---

Example Scenario

Create Quote

1. User sends a request to create a quote for auto insurance.


2. Command handler validates the request and generates a QuoteCreated event.


3. The event is stored in the event store and triggers:

Update to "Active Quotes" projection.

Notification to the underwriting service.





---

Benefits

1. Auditability: Track all changes to quotes.


2. Flexibility: Rebuild projections for new use cases without schema changes.


3. Scalability: Handle large volumes of quotes across multiple regions.


4. Resilience: Recover from system failures using the event store.
