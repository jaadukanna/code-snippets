The decision to implement command handlers and event handlers in the same Spring Boot application or in separate deployments depends on your architectural goals, such as scalability, modularity, and operational complexity. Here are the pros and cons of each approach to help guide your decision:


---

Option 1: Same Spring Boot Application

Description:

Command and event handlers reside in the same Spring Boot application, sharing the same deployment.

Advantages:

1. Simpler Development and Deployment:

Fewer services to manage.

Easier to debug and test locally, as all components are together.



2. Lower Latency:

No inter-service communication overhead between command and event handlers.



3. Shared Codebase:

No need to duplicate business logic or data models across services.



4. Cost-Effective:

Single deployment means lower infrastructure and operational costs.




Disadvantages:

1. Limited Scalability:

Command and event processing workloads cannot be scaled independently.

If event processing requires significantly more resources, it could affect command handling performance.



2. Reduced Modularity:

Tight coupling of components might make future changes or replacements harder.



3. Operational Complexity for Large-Scale Systems:

Managing different workloads (e.g., synchronous API calls and asynchronous event processing) in one service can complicate monitoring and logging.




When to Choose:

Suitable for small to medium systems where the quoting service is not expected to handle a high volume of concurrent requests or events.

When simplicity is a priority, and independent scaling is not a critical requirement.

Option 2: Separate Deployments

Description:

Command handlers and event handlers are implemented as separate Spring Boot applications with distinct deployments.

Advantages:

1. Independent Scalability:

Command handlers and event handlers can scale independently based on their specific workloads.

For example, event handlers can process large batches of events without affecting command execution performance.



2. Modularity and Separation of Concerns:

Clear separation of responsibilities makes the system easier to maintain and evolve.

Easier to introduce additional services (e.g., specialized event handlers) in the future.



3. Resilience:

Failure in event processing will not affect the ability to handle commands, or vice versa.

Each service can have independent monitoring and retry mechanisms.



4. Flexibility for Cloud-Native Architectures:

Suitable for containerized or serverless deployments, allowing each service to use tailored configurations and runtime environments.




Disadvantages:

1. Increased Operational Complexity:

Multiple services mean more deployment pipelines, monitoring dashboards, and debugging complexity.

Requires a reliable communication mechanism between services (e.g., via Azure Event Hubs).



2. Latency Overhead:

Inter-service communication introduces additional latency compared to the same application.



3. Higher Cost:

Separate deployments may lead to higher infrastructure costs due to additional resources required for each service.




When to Choose:

Suitable for large-scale systems with high volumes of concurrent requests and events.

When the system needs to scale specific components independently.

When you want a modular architecture for easier future evolution.

Recommendation

1. Start with a Single Deployment (Option 1):

For initial implementation or MVP, keep command and event handlers in the same application for simplicity.

Optimize the system, gain insights into bottlenecks, and assess scaling needs.



2. Evolve to Separate Deployments (Option 2):

As the system grows, separate command and event handlers into distinct services to handle increased load or enable independent scaling.





---

Hybrid Approach

You can also implement a hybrid approach where:

1. Keep core command and event handling in one application initially.


2. Offload heavy or specific event-processing tasks (e.g., complex projection updates or notifications) to separate microservices as the system evolves.
