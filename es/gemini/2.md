Certainly, let's break down the steps involved in detail, starting from quote creation to event storage and read model synchronization.
1. Quote Creation
 * User Interaction: A broker user fills out a quote request form on the web/mobile app. This form includes details like:
   * Customer Information (Name, Age, Contact)
   * Vehicle Information (Type, Make, Model, Year)
   * Coverage Options (Liability, Collision, Comprehensive)
 * Application Logic:
   * The application validates the input data.
   * A unique identifier (e.g., UUID) is generated for the quote.
   * A QuoteCreated event is created with the following data:
     * quoteId: Unique identifier of the quote.
     * brokerId: Identifier of the broker who created the quote.
     * customerInformation: Customer details.
     * vehicleInformation: Vehicle details.
     * coverageOptions: Selected coverage options.
     * timestamp: Timestamp of the event creation.
2. Event Publishing
 * The QuoteCreated event is published to the event store (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis). This can be done asynchronously using a message queue or synchronously by directly writing to the event store.
3. Event Handling
 * Write Model:
   * An event handler subscribes to the event stream.
   * Upon receiving a QuoteCreated event, the handler creates a new entry in the write model (e.g., a document in MongoDB) with the following:
     * quoteId: Unique identifier of the quote.
     * status: "CREATED"
     * createdAt: Timestamp of quote creation.
     * brokerId: Identifier of the broker.
     * customerInformation: Customer details.
     * vehicleInformation: Vehicle details.
     * coverageOptions: Selected coverage options.
     * eventHistory: An array to store all events related to this quote. Initially, it contains the QuoteCreated event.
 * Read Model:
   * Materialized View: The read model can be a materialized view of the write model. This can be achieved using:
     * Change Data Capture (CDC): The database (e.g., MongoDB) can be configured to capture changes to the write model and trigger updates to the read model.
     * Event Replay: The read model can be periodically rebuilt by replaying all events from the event store. This approach is more suitable for complex read models or when CDC is not feasible.
   * Structure: The read model can be optimized for specific queries, such as:
     * Summary View: A simplified view with key attributes for quick retrieval and display.
     * Search Index: Indexes for efficient searching and filtering.
4. Subsequent Events
 * As the quote progresses (e.g., risk assessment, approval/decline), new events are generated and published:
   * RiskAssessmentStarted
   * RiskAssessmentCompleted
   * QuoteApproved
   * QuoteDeclined
 * Event Handling:
   * Each event handler updates the write model and triggers updates to the read model.
   * The eventHistory array in the write model is updated with each new event.
Example: Handling a RiskAssessmentCompleted Event
 * Write Model:
   * The event handler updates the status field to "RISK_ASSESSED".
   * It adds the RiskAssessmentCompleted event to the eventHistory array.
 * Read Model:
   * The materialized view is updated to reflect the new status.
   * If the read model has a summary view, it updates the relevant fields (e.g., risk assessment status).
Key Considerations
 * Event Store Choice: The choice of event store (Kafka, Kinesis, EventStoreDB) depends on factors like throughput, latency, scalability, and integration with existing infrastructure.
 * Read Model Optimization: The design of the read model is crucial for performance. Consider using caching, indexes, and appropriate data partitioning strategies.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that events are processed correctly and that the read model remains consistent with the write model.
 * Testing: Thoroughly test the event handling logic and read model synchronization to ensure data integrity and system stability.
This detailed example illustrates the core concepts of Event Sourcing in the context of an insurance quoting service. By implementing this approach, you can build a system that is more flexible, scalable, and maintainable, while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations.
