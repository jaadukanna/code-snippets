Designing and Implementing Event Sourcing for an Insurance Quoting Service
Understanding the Problem
In the insurance domain, a quoting service is a critical component that provides potential customers with an estimated cost for insurance coverage. This involves complex calculations based on various factors like age, location, vehicle type, driving history, and more. Traditional approaches often rely on complex SQL queries or in-memory calculations, which can become cumbersome to maintain and scale as the business grows.
Event Sourcing Solution
Event Sourcing is a pattern where all changes to an application state are captured as a sequence of events. These events are stored in an append-only store, providing an immutable and auditable history of the system. In the context of an insurance quoting service, this means capturing every change made to a quote as an event.
Design Considerations
 * Event Types: Define a comprehensive set of event types to capture all relevant changes to a quote, such as:
   * QuoteCreated: Triggered when a new quote is initiated.
   * CustomerInformationUpdated: Triggered when customer details are modified.
   * VehicleInformationUpdated: Triggered when vehicle information is changed.
   * RiskAssessmentCompleted: Triggered when the risk assessment is finished.
   * QuoteApproved: Triggered when the quote is approved.
   * QuoteDeclined: Triggered when the quote is declined.
 * Event Store: Choose a suitable event store, such as:
   * Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform that can handle high throughput and low latency.
   * Amazon Kinesis: A scalable and durable stream processing service.
   * EventStoreDB: A dedicated event store database.
 * Event Handling: Implement event handlers to process incoming events and update the quote state accordingly. These handlers can be implemented as microservices or within the quoting service itself.
 * Read Model: Create a read model to provide a more efficient way to query and present quote data. This can be a materialized view, a separate database, or a combination of both.
Implementation Approach
 * Event Generation: When a user interacts with the quoting service, generate corresponding events and publish them to the event store.
 * Event Handling: Subscribe to the event stream and process incoming events. Update the quote state based on the event type and data.
 * Read Model Updates: Keep the read model synchronized with the event store. This can be done using a change data capture mechanism or by periodically replaying events.
 * Quote Calculation: Use the updated quote state from the read model to perform the final quote calculation.
Benefits of Event Sourcing
 * Immutability: Events are immutable, providing a reliable and auditable history of the system.
 * Flexibility: New features and functionalities can be added by creating new event handlers without affecting existing code.
 * Scalability: Event stores can be scaled horizontally to handle increasing data volumes.
 * Debugging: The event log can be used to replay events and debug issues.
Additional Considerations
 * Event Serialization: Choose a suitable serialization format for events, such as JSON or Protobuf.
 * Event Versioning: Implement a versioning mechanism to handle changes to event schemas.
 * Security: Ensure that events are securely stored and accessed.
 * Performance: Optimize event handling and read model updates for performance.
By adopting Event Sourcing, insurance companies can build more flexible, scalable, and maintainable quoting services that can adapt to changing business requirements and provide a better customer experience.
