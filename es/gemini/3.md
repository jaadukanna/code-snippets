You're absolutely right. In an Event Sourcing system, the write model would indeed contain a record for each quote, and this record would include an array of events capturing its entire history.
Here's how the read model is typically updated in such a scenario:
1. Event Handlers and Projections:
 * Event Handlers: When an event (e.g., RiskAssessmentCompleted) is published, the corresponding event handler is triggered. This handler is responsible for updating the write model and initiating the read model update.
 * Projections: Projections are the mechanisms that transform events into the read model. They can be:
   * In-memory: Simple projections can be handled within the event handler itself.
   * External: More complex projections might involve separate services or processes that subscribe to the event stream and update the read model asynchronously.
2. Read Model Update Strategies:
 * Incremental Updates:
   * Change Data Capture (CDC): If the write model is in a database, CDC tools can capture changes (e.g., new events added to the eventHistory array). The projection then reacts to these changes and updates the read model accordingly.
   * Event Stream Subscription: Projections can directly subscribe to the event stream. When a new event arrives, the projection updates the read model based on the event data.
 * Periodic Updates:
   * Event Replay: The projection can periodically replay all events from the beginning for a given quote. This is useful for:
     * Initializing the read model.
     * Recalculating the read model after significant changes or errors.
     * Handling complex projections that require processing the entire event history.
3. Example: RiskAssessmentCompleted Event
Let's assume the read model has a field currentStatus.
 * Event Handler:
   * Updates the status field in the write model to "RISK_ASSESSED".
   * Adds the RiskAssessmentCompleted event to the eventHistory array.
   * Triggers the read model projection.
 * Projection:
   * Receives the RiskAssessmentCompleted event.
   * Updates the currentStatus field in the read model to "RISK_ASSESSED".
Key Considerations:
 * Projection Complexity: The complexity of the projection will depend on the specific requirements of the read model.
 * Performance: For high-throughput systems, efficient projections are crucial. Consider techniques like batching, caching, and indexing.
 * Consistency: Ensure that the read model remains consistent with the write model, especially during updates.
By carefully designing and implementing these mechanisms, you can effectively synchronize the read model with the ever-evolving state of the quote, as captured by the event stream.
I hope this more detailed explanation clarifies how read models are updated in an Event Sourcing system with multiple events per quote!
