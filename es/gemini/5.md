Using MongoDB as an Event Store and Implementing Projections
1. Event Storage in MongoDB
 * Collection: Create a dedicated MongoDB collection to store all events.
 * Document Structure: Each document in this collection represents an event.
   * eventType: The type of the event (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "OrderShipped").
   * aggregateId: Unique identifier of the entity (e.g., order ID, customer ID).
   * eventId: Unique identifier of the event.
   * data: The event data (e.g., order details, customer information).
   * timestamp: Timestamp of the event occurrence.
2. Projection Implementation
 * Change Streams: MongoDB provides Change Streams, which allow you to efficiently observe changes to data in a collection.
 * Projection Logic:
   * Subscribe to Change Stream: Create a Change Stream on the events collection.
   * Handle Events: For each change in the stream:
     * Extract the eventType and data from the event document.
     * Apply the appropriate logic to update the read model based on the event type.
       * Example:
         * If eventType is "OrderPlaced":
           * Create a new document in the "orders" collection with order details.
         * If eventType is "OrderShipped":
           * Update the "status" field in the "orders" collection to "Shipped".
3. Read Model
 * Separate Collection: Create a separate collection in MongoDB to store the read model data.
 * Structure: Design the read model collection to optimize for specific queries and reporting needs.
4. Projection Execution
 * Dedicated Service: Run a separate service or process to handle the Change Stream and execute the projection logic. This allows for better isolation and scalability.
 * Example:
   * A Node.js or Python application can subscribe to the Change Stream using the MongoDB driver.
   * The application can then perform the necessary updates to the read model based on the received events.
Example Code Snippet (Conceptual - Node.js)
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function run() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://<your_connection_string>');
  await client.connect();
  const eventsCollection = client.db('your_database').collection('events');
  const ordersCollection = client.db('your_database').collection('orders');

  const changeStream = eventsCollection.watch();

  changeStream.on('change', (change) => {
    if (change.operationType === 'insert') {
      const event = change.fullDocument;
      if (event.eventType === 'OrderPlaced') {
        ordersCollection.insertOne({
          orderId: event.aggregateId,
          // ... other order details
        });
      }
      // Handle other event types similarly
    }
  });

  await client.close();
}

run().catch(console.error);

Key Considerations:
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to ensure that projections are processed correctly and that the read model remains consistent with the event stream.
 * Idempotency: Ensure that projections are idempotent, meaning they can be safely replayed multiple times without producing unintended side effects.
 * Performance: Optimize projections for performance by using appropriate indexes, batching updates, and efficient query patterns.
 * Scalability: Consider scaling the projection service horizontally to handle increasing event throughput.
By using this approach, you can effectively leverage MongoDB's Change Streams to implement efficient and scalable projections for your Event Sourcing architecture.
