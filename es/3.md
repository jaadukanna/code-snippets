In an Event Sourcing system, the WRITE model in Azure Cosmos DB (or any other database) is designed to capture the raw events in an immutable form. Here's how you can structure the WRITE model in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB:


---

WRITE Model Design

Structure

The WRITE model in Cosmos DB stores immutable events. Each event corresponds to a change or action taken on a quote. For every new change (e.g., a quote update, coverage addition, etc.), a new document is added to the WRITE model. This ensures that:

The history of all changes is preserved.

The state of a quote can be rebuilt by replaying the events.



---

Document Structure

Each event is stored as a separate document in a collection. Here's an example schema for events:

Event Document Example

{
  "eventId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",  // Unique ID for the event
  "quoteId": "Q12345",                                // ID of the quote
  "eventType": "QuoteCreated",                       // Type of event (e.g., QuoteCreated, QuoteUpdated)
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:34:56Z",               // When the event occurred
  "data": {                                          // Event-specific payload
    "product": "Auto",
    "premium": 1200,
    "coverageDetails": {
      "liability": 100000,
      "collision": 50000
    },
    "customerId": "C67890"
  },
  "metadata": {                                      // Optional metadata
    "correlationId": "abc-123-def-456",
    "source": "QuotingService",
    "userId": "U56789"
  }
}

Key Fields:

1. eventId: Unique identifier for each event.


2. quoteId: Identifies the quote this event belongs to.


3. eventType: Describes the type of event (e.g., QuoteCreated, QuoteUpdated).


4. timestamp: When the event was generated.


5. data: Contains the business-specific details of the event.


6. metadata: Additional details for tracking or auditing (e.g., user who triggered the event).

WRITE Model Workflow

1. On New Event Generation:

A new document is added to the WRITE model collection for each new event.

Events are immutable; they are never updated or deleted.



2. Event Ordering:

Use quoteId as a partition key to ensure all events for a quote are stored together.

Use timestamp for sorting and replaying events in order.



3. Query Example:

To rebuild the current state of a quote:

{
  "quoteId": "Q12345"
}

Sort by timestamp to process events in the correct order.





---

Why Add a New Document for Every Change?

1. Immutability:

Events must remain unchanged to maintain an accurate history.



2. Auditability:

Every change to a quote is recorded, providing a complete audit trail.



3. Reproducibility:

The current state of a quote can be rebuilt at any point in time by replaying all events.



4. Scalability:

Adding new documents (append-only) is more performant in Cosmos DB than updating existing documents.



5. Flexibility:

New business requirements can be addressed by replaying events to build new projections or states.

Collection Example

Assume a collection named quote_events for storing the WRITE model.

Sample Documents:

Event 1: QuoteCreated

{
  "eventId": "e1",
  "quoteId": "Q12345",
  "eventType": "QuoteCreated",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "product": "Auto",
    "premium": 1200,
    "customerId": "C67890"
  }
}

Event 2: CoverageAdded

{
  "eventId": "e2",
  "quoteId": "Q12345",
  "eventType": "CoverageAdded",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "coverageType": "Liability",
    "amount": 100000
  }
}

Event 3: QuoteUpdated

{
  "eventId": "e3",
  "quoteId": "Q12345",
  "eventType": "QuoteUpdated",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T13:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "premium": 1300
  }
}

Considerations for Cosmos DB

1. Partitioning:

Use quoteId as the partition key to ensure all events for a specific quote are grouped together.

This minimizes cross-partition queries and improves performance.



2. Indexing:

Use timestamp indexing for fast sorting and replay.

Optimize for queries like "Get all events for a quote."



3. Retention Policy:

Events are typically kept forever for auditability.

If storage becomes an issue, older events could be archived to cheaper storage like Azure Blob.



4. Throughput:

Provision sufficient RU/s (Request Units) based on event volume.





---

Key Benefits of This Model

1. High Write Throughput:

Append-only operations are optimized for Cosmos DB.



2. Replayable History:

Full event history for rebuilding the state of quotes.



3. Scalability:

Cosmos DBâ€™s partitioning and autoscaling support large event volumes.



4. Cloud-Native:

Fully managed with global distribution and high availability.
