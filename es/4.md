In an Event Sourcing architecture, projections and event replay mechanisms are critical for building and maintaining the READ model, which provides queryable views for the application.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of both concepts in the context of your architecture:


---

Projections (READ Model)

Purpose

Projections transform raw, immutable events from the WRITE model into denormalized views or aggregates stored in a queryable format (e.g., in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB).

These views are optimized for specific queries like fetching quote details, active quotes, or aggregating premiums.



---

Design

Projections in Azure Cosmos DB consist of collections tailored to query patterns. For example:

quote_details: Contains the latest state of each quote.

active_quotes: Contains only quotes in an "active" status.

premium_summary: Aggregates premiums by product type, region, etc.



---

Projection Workflow

1. Consume Events:

Event handlers (running as Spring Boot services) consume events from Azure Event Hubs.

Example events: QuoteCreated, QuoteUpdated, CoverageAdded.



2. Process Events:

For each event, the handler:

Reads the event data.

Updates or creates the corresponding projection document.




3. Store Projections:

Write the transformed data to Azure Cosmos DB collections.

Projection Example

Event Stream in WRITE Model

[
  { "eventId": "e1", "quoteId": "Q12345", "eventType": "QuoteCreated", "data": { "product": "Auto", "premium": 1200 } },
  { "eventId": "e2", "quoteId": "Q12345", "eventType": "CoverageAdded", "data": { "coverageType": "Liability", "amount": 100000 } },
  { "eventId": "e3", "quoteId": "Q12345", "eventType": "QuoteUpdated", "data": { "premium": 1300 } }
]

Projection in READ Model

Collection: quote_details


{
  "quoteId": "Q12345",
  "product": "Auto",
  "premium": 1300,
  "coverage": [
    { "coverageType": "Liability", "amount": 100000 }
  ],
  "status": "Active"
}

Example Code for Event Processing

Consuming Events and Updating Projections:

@Service
public class EventProcessor {
    private final CosmosTemplate cosmosTemplate;

    public EventProcessor(CosmosTemplate cosmosTemplate) {
        this.cosmosTemplate = cosmosTemplate;
    }

    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        switch (event.getEventType()) {
            case "QuoteCreated":
                createProjection(event);
                break;
            case "CoverageAdded":
                addCoverage(event);
                break;
            case "QuoteUpdated":
                updateQuote(event);
                break;
        }
    }

    private void createProjection(Event event) {
        QuoteDetails projection = new QuoteDetails(event.getQuoteId(), event.getData().getProduct(), event.getData().getPremium());
        cosmosTemplate.insert(projection, "quote_details");
    }

    private void addCoverage(Event event) {
        Query query = new Query(Criteria.where("quoteId").is(event.getQuoteId()));
        Update update = new Update().push("coverage", event.getData());
        cosmosTemplate.update(query, update, "quote_details");
    }

    private void updateQuote(Event event) {
        Query query = new Query(Criteria.where("quoteId").is(event.getQuoteId()));
        Update update = new Update().set("premium", event.getData().getPremium());
        cosmosTemplate.update(query, update, "quote_details");
    }
}

Event Replay

Purpose

Event replay is used to:

1. Rebuild Projections:

Recreate the READ model (projections) in case of failure or schema changes.



2. Debugging and Auditing:

Replay historical events to troubleshoot or verify system behavior.





---

Workflow

1. Fetch Events:

Retrieve all events for a specific quoteId or event type from the WRITE model in Azure Cosmos DB.



2. Sort Events:

Sort events by timestamp to ensure they are processed in the correct order.



3. Process Events:

Replay each event through the event handlers to rebuild the projection.





---

Event Replay Example

Replay Logic:

public void replayEvents(String quoteId) {
    // Fetch all events for the given quoteId
    Query query = new Query(Criteria.where("quoteId").is(quoteId));
    query.with(Sort.by("timestamp").ascending());
    List<Event> events = cosmosTemplate.find(query, Event.class, "quote_events");

    // Replay events
    events.forEach(this::processEvent);
}

Rebuilding the Entire Projection:

public void rebuildProjections() {
    // Fetch all events from the WRITE model
    Query query = new Query();
    query.with(Sort.by("timestamp").ascending());
    List<Event> events = cosmosTemplate.find(query, Event.class, "quote_events");

    // Process each event
    events.forEach(this::processEvent);
}


---

Key Considerations for Event Replay

1. Idempotency:

Ensure event handlers are idempotent to avoid duplicate processing during replay.

Example: Use an eventId to track processed events.



2. Parallel Replay:

Replay events in parallel for improved performance but maintain order within each partition (e.g., quoteId).



3. Large Scale Replay:

For large event streams, consider using Azure Batch or Spark on Azure Databricks to process events.



4. Rebuilding Projections Selectively:

Replay only for a subset of quotes or events if a specific projection was corrupted.

Projections vs Event Replay

Tools for Automation

Use Azure Data Factory or Durable Functions for orchestrating large-scale replay jobs.

Leverage Cosmos DB's change feed to detect updates in the WRITE model and trigger projection updates automatically.
