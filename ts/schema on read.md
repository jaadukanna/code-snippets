To support multiple business entities with their own evolving schemas while ensuring schema-on-read functionality, you can implement a system with robust schema validation, versioning, and dynamic processing capabilities. Here's how to approach it:


---

1. Use a Schema Registry for Schema Management

A schema registry is a centralized service for storing and managing schemas. It ensures that:

Each business entity has its schema stored and versioned.

Schemas can evolve without breaking compatibility.


Key Benefits:

Centralized control over schemas.

Compatibility checks for schema evolution.

Efficient schema validation during message read.


How to Implement:

1. Use tools like Confluent Schema Registry (if using Apache Kafka) or create a custom registry service.


2. Store schemas as JSON, Avro, or Protobuf definitions.


3. Assign each schema a unique identifier and version.

2. Schema-on-Read Implementation

Overview:

With schema-on-read, data producers send raw payloads, and consumers validate them dynamically against the schema during processing.

Steps:

1. Producer Responsibility:

Include a reference to the schema ID and version in the Kafka message (e.g., in headers or payload).

Produce messages in a standard format (e.g., JSON, Avro).


Example of message with schema reference:

{
    "schemaId": "customer-v2",
    "payload": {
        "customerId": "12345",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
}


2. Consumer Responsibility:

Retrieve the schema ID and version from the message.

Fetch the corresponding schema from the schema registry.

Validate the payload against the schema during read.





---

3. Schema Validation During Read

Validation ensures the payload adheres to the expected schema. Use libraries based on the schema format.

JSON Schema Validation:

Define schemas in JSON Schema format.

Use a library like ajv for validation.


Install ajv:

npm install ajv

Example:

import Ajv, { JSONSchemaType } from 'ajv';

// Example schema
const schema: JSONSchemaType<{ customerId: string; name: string; email: string }> = {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
        customerId: { type: "string" },
        name: { type: "string" },
        email: { type: "string", format: "email" },
    },
    required: ["customerId", "name", "email"],
};

// Validate payload
const ajv = new Ajv();
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);

const payload = {
    customerId: "12345",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
};

if (validate(payload)) {
    console.log("Payload is valid.");
} else {
    console.error("Validation errors:", validate.errors);
}

Avro/Protobuf Validation:

Use Avro or Protobuf for compact schemas.

Validate with libraries like avsc (for Avro) or protobuf.js.

4. Schema Evolution

Handle schema changes by implementing versioning and compatibility rules.

Schema Compatibility Types:

Backward-Compatible: New schema can read old data.

Forward-Compatible: Old schema can read new data.

Full-Compatible: Both directions are supported.


How to Evolve:

1. Add fields with default values.


2. Avoid removing or renaming fields.


3. Use schema registry tools to enforce compatibility.




---

5. Dynamic Schema Processing

For multiple entities with different schemas, dynamically fetch and validate schemas based on the message metadata.

Example Workflow:

1. Producer:

Sends schema ID with each message.

E.g., Kafka message headers: { schemaId: "customer-v2" }.



2. Consumer:

Extracts schema ID from the message.

Fetches schema from the schema registry.

Validates the payload against the schema.




Example Code:

async function processMessage(message: any) {
    const { schemaId, payload } = message;

    // Fetch schema dynamically
    const schema = await fetchSchema(schemaId); // e.g., API call to schema registry

    // Validate payload
    const validate = ajv.compile(schema);
    if (!validate(payload)) {
        throw new Error(`Validation failed for schema ${schemaId}: ${validate.errors}`);
    }

    console.log("Payload processed successfully:", payload);
}

async function fetchSchema(schemaId: string): Promise<any> {
    // Simulated schema registry call
    const schemas = {
        "customer-v2": {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                customerId: { type: "string" },
                name: { type: "string" },
                email: { type: "string", format: "email" },
            },
            required: ["customerId", "name", "email"],
        },
    };
    return schemas[schemaId];
}


---

6. Monitoring and Alerting for Schema Errors

1. Log Validation Errors:

Capture schema validation failures in logs for debugging.

Include the schemaId and offending payload.



2. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):

Route invalid messages to a DLQ for manual inspection.



3. Metrics and Alerts:

Track validation error rates.

Set alerts for spikes in invalid messages.





---

7. Deployment Considerations

Schema Registry Availability:

Use a highly available schema registry to avoid downtime during schema fetches.


Versioning Strategy:

Maintain backward-compatible schemas for seamless evolution.

Document schema changes and their impact.


Dynamic Updates:

Cache schemas locally for performance and reduce registry calls.




---

Summary

1. Use a schema registry to manage and version schemas centrally.


2. Implement schema-on-read by validating payloads against dynamically fetched schemas.


3. Handle schema evolution with compatibility rules to ensure smooth upgrades.


4. Use JSON Schema, Avro, or Protobuf for schema definitions, depending on your requirements.


5. Ensure robust error handling, monitoring, and alerting for invalid payloads.



This approach allows your system to support multiple business entities, evolve their schemas seamlessly, and maintain reliability in a dynamic environment.
