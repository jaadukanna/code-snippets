Yes, the generated unique IDs should be part of the request published to Kafka. Including unique IDs in the Kafka messages offers several benefits, which enhance reliability, traceability, and processing efficiency across the system.

Why Should Unique IDs Be Included in Kafka Messages?

1. Idempotency

When the unique ID is part of the message, consumers can detect duplicate messages by checking if the eventId already exists in their storage or processing system.

This ensures that repeated processing of the same event (due to retries or re-deliveries) does not lead to inconsistent or duplicate data.


2. Traceability

A unique ID allows you to trace the lifecycle of an event across the system.

You can monitor and debug workflows by correlating log entries, metrics, and system states using the eventId.


3. Referential Integrity

When a system publishes events to Kafka, downstream consumers may need to associate these events with other entities or records.

The unique eventId acts as a reference point, making it easier to maintain relationships between events.


4. Accountability

In systems involving auditing or compliance requirements, a unique eventId can be used to record and track event history for accountability.


5. Event Replays

During replays or backfills, a unique ID ensures that replayed events are treated as the original event, avoiding duplicate or incorrect processing.


6. Simplifies Deduplication Logic

Consumers can use the eventId to maintain a deduplication cache or lookup table, ensuring that only one instance of the message is processed.

How to Add the Unique ID to Kafka Messages?

1. Generate the ID Before Publishing:

Ensure the unique ID is generated at the producer level and is part of the payload or message headers.



2. Include the ID in the Message Payload:

Add the eventId as a field in the message body.


{
    "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "eventType": "QuoteCreated",
    "timestamp": 1678813207123,
    "data": {
        "quoteId": "Q12345",
        "customerId": "C98765",
        "amount": 250.00
    }
}


3. Optionally Add the ID to Message Headers:

Kafka supports custom headers that can include metadata like eventId. For example:


await producer.send({
    topic: 'example-topic',
    messages: [
        {
            value: JSON.stringify(eventPayload),
            headers: { eventId: eventId },
        },
    ],
});

Best Practices for Including Unique IDs

1. Consistency:

Always include the eventId in every Kafka message, regardless of the event type or producer.



2. Validation:

Ensure the eventId follows a standard format (e.g., UUID, ULID) and is validated before publishing.



3. Use in Consumer Logic:

Consumers should prioritize processing based on the eventId for deduplication, idempotency, and tracking.



4. Use Headers for Metadata:

While the eventId can be in the payload, adding it to message headers allows for efficient access without parsing the message body.



5. Avoid Overwriting:

Do not regenerate or overwrite the eventId downstream to preserve traceability and idempotency.

Downstream Processing Considerations

Database Updates:

Use the eventId to log or store events in the database. For example:

MongoDB Collection: { _id: eventId, data: <event data>, processedAt: <timestamp> }.



Deduplication Cache:

Maintain a cache or database of processed eventIds to skip duplicates.


Audit Logs:

Record the eventId in audit logs to provide a historical record of processed events.

Summary

Including the unique eventId in Kafka messages is highly recommended. It ensures:

1. Idempotency in message processing.


2. Traceability across systems.


3. Simplified debugging and monitoring.


4. Compliance with audit requirements.



By embedding the eventId in both the payload and/or headers, your system becomes more reliable and robust in handling distributed event-driven workflows.
