Designing a system like this involves several components working together seamlessly to generate, process, and react to business events. Below is a proposed design for such a system using TypeScript, MongoDB, and Kafka:


---

System Design Overview

1. API Gateway:

Receives client requests and validates them.

Converts requests into business events (e.g., QuoteRequested, EnrollmentInitiated).

Publishes events to Kafka.



2. Kafka:

Acts as the backbone of the event-driven system.

Topics are created for each type of business event (e.g., quote-events, enrollment-events).

Multiple consumers listen to these topics.



3. Event Store in MongoDB:

Collections:

Event Log Collection: Appends each event for historical tracking.

Entity State Collection: Stores the current state of entities (e.g., quotes, enrollments).


Events are processed by a consumer, which appends to the event log and updates the entity state.



4. Event Processing Logic:

After updating MongoDB, another event is generated (e.g., EntityUpdatedEvent) and sent to Kafka for other systems to act on.



5. Event Consumers:

Other systems listen to the Kafka topics to react to business events.

Detailed Components

1. API Layer (Express.js or NestJS)

Use TypeScript with a framework like Express.js or NestJS for building the API.

Sample Code for API:


import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs';

const app = express();
const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'api', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });
const producer = kafka.producer();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/quote', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const event = {
        type: 'QuoteRequested',
        data: req.body,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };

    await producer.connect();
    await producer.send({
        topic: 'quote-events',
        messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify(event) }],
    });

    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Quote event published.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));


---

2. Kafka Topics

Create Kafka topics:

quote-events: For events related to quotes.

entity-updates: For events generated after MongoDB updates.


Topic Partitioning:

Use appropriate partition keys (e.g., entity IDs) to ensure scalability.




---

3. MongoDB Event Store

Collections:

event_logs: Logs all events for traceability.

entities: Stores the latest state of entities.


Schema Example:


// Event Logs Schema
const eventLogSchema = new Schema({
    eventId: { type: String, required: true },
    eventType: { type: String, required: true },
    eventData: { type: Object, required: true },
    timestamp: { type: Date, required: true },
});

// Entity State Schema
const entitySchema = new Schema({
    entityId: { type: String, required: true },
    state: { type: Object, required: true },
    updatedAt: { type: Date, required: true },
});


---

4. Kafka Consumer for MongoDB

A Kafka consumer listens to quote-events and updates MongoDB.


import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'mongo-consumer', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'mongo-group' });

await consumer.connect();
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'quote-events', fromBeginning: true });

consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
        const event = JSON.parse(message.value?.toString() || '{}');

        // Append to event log
        await EventLog.create(event);

        // Update entity state
        const { entityId, state } = event.data;
        await Entity.updateOne(
            { entityId },
            { state, updatedAt: new Date() },
            { upsert: true }
        );

        // Raise an update event
        const updateEvent = {
            type: 'EntityUpdatedEvent',
            data: { entityId, state },
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        };

        await producer.send({
            topic: 'entity-updates',
            messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify(updateEvent) }],
        });
    },
});

5. Event-Driven Reactors

Other systems consume the entity-updates topic to react to state changes.

Example: A notification service sends an email when a quote is updated.



---

Deployment and Observability

Deployment:

Use Docker for containerizing services.

Deploy Kafka using Kubernetes or a managed service (e.g., Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK).


Monitoring:

Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for metrics.

Enable Kafka and MongoDB logs for troubleshooting.




---

Key Considerations

1. Idempotency: Ensure consumers handle duplicate messages gracefully.


2. Schema Evolution: Use a schema registry (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry) for Kafka to manage event schema versions.


3. Error Handling: Implement retries and dead-letter queues for failed messages.


4. Security:

Secure Kafka with TLS and authentication.

Protect MongoDB with role-based access control.




This design provides a robust event-driven architecture where your APIs, Kafka, and MongoDB work together seamlessly to process and react to business events.
