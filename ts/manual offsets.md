Manual offset commits are essential when processing Kafka messages to ensure exactly-once or at-least-once delivery semantics. Here's a detailed explanation of why they are needed and how they are handled:


---

Why Are Manual Offset Commits Required?

1. Message Processing Guarantees

Kafka operates with "at-least-once" delivery semantics by default. This means:

A message will be delivered at least once but might be redelivered if the consumer doesn't commit its offset after processing.


To avoid processing the same message multiple times, you need precise control over when an offset is committed.

2. Control Over Offset Commit Timing

In auto-commit mode, Kafka automatically commits the offset at regular intervals (default is every 5 seconds). This approach:

Can lead to lost messages if the consumer crashes after committing but before processing the message.

Provides no guarantee that a message has been successfully processed before the offset is committed.


In manual commit mode, the consumer explicitly commits the offset only after successful processing of the message. This ensures:

The offset is committed only after the message is fully processed.

In case of failure, the message can be reprocessed.



3. Error Handling and Retry

If message processing fails, manual commits allow you to:

Avoid committing the offset.

Retry the message without skipping it or leaving it unprocessed.

How Are Manual Offset Commits Handled?

1. Kafka Consumer Offset Management

Kafka tracks the last committed offset for each partition and consumer group. The consumer's responsibility is to commit the offset at the appropriate time.

2. Types of Offset Commits

Synchronous Offset Commits:

Block the consumer until the commit is acknowledged by Kafka.

Guarantees that the offset is successfully committed.


Asynchronous Offset Commits:

Commit offsets in the background without blocking the consumer.

May fail silently, requiring error handling.



3. Key APIs for Manual Commit

Kafka consumer libraries (e.g., KafkaJS or Confluent Kafka) provide APIs for manual offset commits.

Manual Offset Commit Example

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example using KafkaJS:

1. Consumer Setup

Connect to the Kafka cluster and subscribe to a topic:

import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs';

const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'example-client', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'example-group' });

await consumer.connect();
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'example-topic', fromBeginning: true });

2. Processing Messages with Manual Commits

Implement manual offset commits inside the message processing logic:

await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
        const offset = message.offset;
        const value = message.value?.toString();

        try {
            console.log(`Processing message: ${value}`);

            // Perform message processing (e.g., update database)
            await processMessage(value);

            // Commit the offset after successful processing
            await consumer.commitOffsets([
                { topic, partition, offset: (parseInt(offset) + 1).toString() },
            ]);
            console.log(`Offset committed for message: ${offset}`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error processing message: ${error.message}`);
            // Do not commit the offset, so the message will be retried
        }
    },
});

Key Considerations for Manual Offset Commits

1. Commit Offset After Successful Processing

Ensure you only commit the offset after the message has been successfully processed.

For example, if you update a database, the offset should be committed only after the database transaction is complete.


2. Retry on Failure

If processing fails, do not commit the offset. Kafka will re-deliver the message during the next poll cycle.

Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for robust error handling.


3. Avoid Committing Partial Batches

If you process messages in batches, commit the offset only after all messages in the batch have been successfully processed.

Advanced Considerations

1. Enable Idempotent Processing

To handle potential re-deliveries, ensure your processing logic is idempotent.

For example:

Use a unique message ID to avoid duplicate database inserts.

Use conditional updates in the database (e.g., UPDATE ... WHERE state != NEW_STATE).



2. Use Transactions for Exactly-Once Semantics

Combine manual offset commits with database transactions to achieve exactly-once processing.

Example with MongoDB:


const session = await mongoose.startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
    await processMessageWithTransaction(message, session);
    await consumer.commitOffsets([{ topic, partition, offset: nextOffset }]);
    await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
    await session.abortTransaction();
    console.error(`Transaction failed: ${error.message}`);
}

3. Dead-Letter Queues

If a message repeatedly fails, move it to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for manual intervention.

Summary

Manual offset commits provide:

1. Reliability: Ensure offsets are only committed after successful processing.


2. Control: Avoid processing failures leading to data inconsistencies.


3. Error Handling: Enable retries and recovery mechanisms.



By carefully combining manual offset commits with idempotent processing and error handling, you can build a robust and reliable Kafka consumer system.
